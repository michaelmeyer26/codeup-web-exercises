<h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
<ul style="display: none">
    <li>Yellowstone encompasses 3,472 square miles (2,221,766 acres) which makes it larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.</li>
    <li>Yellowstone is home to more than 500 active geysers (more than half the world’s geysers).</li>
    <li>Yellowstone is home to the largest concentration of mammals in the lower 48 states (67 species).</li>
    <li>There are approximately 1,000 miles of hiking trails in Yellowstone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Big Bend National Park</h3>
<ul style="display: none">
    <li>The Rio Grande river serves not only as the edge of the park, but also the border between the USA and Mexico.</li>
    <li>The name Big Bend comes from a large bend in the Rio Grande River along the park boundary.</li>
    <li>Big Bend National Park has the darkest measured skies in the lower 48 states, and star gazing here is obviously superb.</li>
    <li>There park contains 56 species of reptiles, 75 species of mammals, more than 450 species of birds, along with at least 1,200 species of plants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Everglades National Park</h3>
<ul style="display: none">
    <li>There are at least nine different ecosystems that work together to sustain life in the Everglades. These include coastal mangroves, pine flatwoods, hardwood hammocks, and freshwater marl prairies.</li>
    <li>The Everglades is home to the Florida Panther, one of the most endangered species on earth. There are currently less than 100 remaining.</li>
    <li>Thick sawgrass covers much of the Everglades terrain; and while it may look soft, the razors can cut through your clothing.</li>
    <li>The Everglades is often referred to as a “swamp”, but in reality it is a giant, slow moving river.</li>
</ul>
